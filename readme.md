# Sensor Simulation in C

## 📄 Overview

This project simulates a basic **sensor data processing system** written in C. The main goal is to practice core C programming concepts:
- arrays
- pointers
- structs
- file I/O
without using actual microcontroller hardware yet.

---

## 💡 Features

- Read and process simulated sensor data from a CSV file.
- Calculate statistics (average, minimum, maximum).
- Detects thresholds and generate simple alerts.
- Designed to mimic embedded handling logic.
